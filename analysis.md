i have spent the last month reversing and researching this file type, i originally wasn't going to publicize this but i changed my mind because why not, better to be out there.
anyways maybe you'll learn something from this, because i sure did. don't confuse yourself with doom wad's, they are completely different to cod wad's.

i will likely be going after ipak's next, i am not sure if i will release that one like i did with this one however, only time will tell i guess.
anyways enough sidetracking.

wad information:
- name: 'Where's All the Data' - this isn't the offical name, nobody knows what it is so it's just an assumption but knowing 3arc, this is probably what it's called. which is ironic considering this is only online stuff, so not really "all the data". not even all online data too, most online data is hosted on DemonWare server's.
- description/usage: a wad is bascially a file container, the point of this file is to hold several online things like contracts, codtv information, playlists, etc.

now, let's dive into the actual file structure. wad's don't really have a file system like directories, it's basically all in the "`root/main`", in other words there *are* directories before it gets linked, but not after it gets linked, they are all put into the "`root`" folder. i am not sure how 3arc linked them, but it might've been similar to `zone`'s, which has a `zone_source`, for wad's maybe `wad_source`?. to back this up, in my tool when you link a wad, the entries list is done in "alphabetical order"/the order that you are shown in `File Explorer`, 3arc's wad's on the other hand are not in "alphabetical order" which really can only mean they had the assets in a `.csv` then linked each asset like that, similar to zone's.

i have used `online_tu0_mp_english.wad` from `T6_greenlight_mp` build for this document.

to start of, we have the header magic.

i am not entirely sure what `T3w«` stands for, `w` likely stands for `wad` so `T3wad`. `T3` might stand for `Treyarch3` and we know that `Treyarch3` is `Call of Duty: 3`, if this is true then they must've used wad's in CoD3. last but not least, there's `«` which i have no clue what could be for other than maybe an identifier? but i'm not sure.

anyways time to get into the actual file information..

```
magic
string: T3w« hex: 54 33 77 AB
```

now, we have the timestamp.

in my instance, it was this.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d0a247d-8a8a-4bc5-b3bd-0c05610d7f21)

```
timestamp
string: 15/11/2011 6:31:35 AM hex: 4E C2 07 47
```

now we have the number of entries.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1cb9920-208b-4d0e-87f1-dd0a2627dbb9)

```
number of entries
int: 3 hex: 00 00 00 03
```

which was three from this wad. remember each wad can have a different timestamp and number of entries.

after the number of entries is the ffotd version. this is always 0 for pre-release wad's but set to 1 for post-release wad's.

This screenshot is from `rfazio/t6/wads/online_tu15_mp_english.wad`, as you can see it has ffotd version set to 1. `rfazio build` version is from `2013`, so post release. `T6_greenlight_mp` has ffotd version of `0`. this ffotd version is completely seperate from the one the game uses.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04da48b9-1700-4b67-b338-b76457bc729d)

```
ffotd version
int: 0 hex: 00 00 00 00
```

now, we have the entries themselves. remember this can be different depending on your game mode's and game version's wad.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f87f19de-fead-439b-b3d0-cdfe7e34e34a)

after the entry name, there is size and then `00` padding.

after this, you have reached the "end" of the readable by human's section.

the rest is pointless to go through as it's just compressed with basic zlib, nothing interesting.

and just like that, you've learnt pretty much this entire format, atleast the basics of it.

things to note:
- endianness impacts the file (not a shocker).
- all wad's by 3arc are in big endian (except for PC server's for some reason, maybe local build? is auto set to little endian)
- expanding on the above point: the game can also load big endian wad's, it'll just convert it to little endian during run time.
- 3arc used a linker that pulled from a zone_source type folder to link together the assets.
- if your wad is at all invalid, then you cannot play online at all.

the end!
